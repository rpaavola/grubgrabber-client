# App Features

GrabGrabber is a full-stack app which focuses on visual design and database usage.  Its built purpose is to have a one stop shop for building daily/weekly meals and consolidating the needed groceries to one list. As groceries are Grabbed from the store, they can me checked off the list and finally cleared/removed from the database.

# App Lessons Learned & Next Steps

From developing this app have learned how much work is invovled in making a full-stack app.  On top of software engineering, the site also had to be UX designed.  Working as an individual can have it's challenges.  Do enjoy solo work but more so working with a Team.  The next stage of this add would be to add a User Authentication feature. All in all.. am very happy how the app turned out and the functionality of it.

## App Dependencies

"axios": "^1.4.0",
"dotenv": "^16.0.3",
"react": "^18.2.0",
"react-dom": "^18.2.0",
"react-router-dom": "^6.11.1",
"react-scripts": "5.0.1",
"sass": "^1.62.1",

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
